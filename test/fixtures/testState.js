And so are you.</div><div><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/110/204/4bc6de2c8ff9b7d40246dda40967212e_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462475960&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=63a4bbaf86d1daeac26ab21e4a9b5c81\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></div><div><b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Art</b></div><div>Midair is a modern sci-fi shooter with vivid colors, beautiful texture, and a unique style.

The evolution of strategies requires a critical mass of players, playing at different skill levels and intermingling to try and test new emerging and dominant playstyles. The more people that play, the more vigorous this process is and, in turn, the healthier the game is. Going Free to Play allows us to grow a large player base, which is essential to creating the environment which will foster this behavior, by lowering the barrier to entry. At the same time, we’re committed to stellar gameplay experience for both veterans and new players alike. So, why should you back a Free to Play game on Kickstarter? Can’t you just wait for release and play it then? Of course. But we believe in offering you the opportunity to shape our game from the ground up. And we believe in rewarding that enthusiasm with cool things like exclusive skins and accessories. As a team of indie developers, we also believe in creating opportunities for aspiring designers and artists to contribute to this project in a meaningful way. Ultimately, backing Midair means that you’re becoming a part of the Archetype Studios community. More than just getting the game out sooner, it also means that our team is making a commitment to you, our loyal fans!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Maps &amp; Map Making</b></div><div>Great maps are critical to keeping any multiplayer game alive and thriving. We will be working hard to put out as many unique and enjoyable maps as we can, but we also know that the community will ultimately dictate what works and what doesn’t. To facilitate this feedback process,we will be designing a community map-making system that makes it easy for players to build, distribute, and play custom maps. This feature is currently on our roadmap, but can move closer to release as part of our stretch goals.</div><div><b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Matchmaking &amp; Dedicated Servers</b></div><div>Players will have a choice between two systems for joining a match: matchmaking and a server browser. Using our matchmaking system, play with others near your skill level. With our free-to-play model, we expect to have a large pool of players available for you to be matched with at any given time. By utilizing our server browser, you will be able to create, host, or join a custom game with the settings you want. The choice is yours.</div><div><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/109/233/f30b6ed7b24c18470ac3da5e2ca4fc8a_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462469726&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b6feaa714e189ee2928e2d2e02146cd5\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></div><div><b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Stats &amp; Rankings</b></div><div>We love data.

Feel free to explore different roles and playstyles to unlock specific achievements, or poke around to find hidden feats which border on impossible. We’re here to push boundaries and encourage discovery - so get in there!</div><div><b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Game Replays</b></div><div>Recording everything that happens in-game is critical for skilled players who want to go over their routes, strategies and tactics. And, it’s important for players who want to create videos. With our purpose-built replay system, you will be able to watch every grab, return, and midair from any angle, without having to run local screen recording software. This allows you to have maximum computer performance during key moments, while capturing your clutch moments in HD for future use.</div><div><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/137/081/4282eb2248bd826af1dd33926c1c135b_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462762467&amp;q=92&amp;s=f99dc2a92c5eb91c9c5701339bae531e\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></div><div>&nbsp;<b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Custom Tailored Networking</b></div><div>Modern First-Person Shooters require highly customized netcode and lag compensation to ensure that players around the world can enjoy games without worrying about the effects of packet loss, latency, and server location.

During pre-alpha testing we have brought in players from a variety of FPS-Z titles across both North America and Europe to ensure we provide a seamless cross-continent experience that trumps all others.</div><div><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/108/786/a05196c12966438e38be83b8c913aa87_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462467508&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=ad7a47184071db0a3cba11f2f19e6b35\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></div><div><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/106/821/713f05bd2b4fda722c2ee98047b89bb2_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462454779&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=311820b32013c1552e5bcca0d6270cdf\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></div><div><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/112/978/5d527da44a200b50c69d84c64ef08dc5_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462495794&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b3dbafaef7798ff1aa60e91bccf4bd60\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></div><div>&nbsp;<b style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Gold Crates &nbsp;</b></div><div>These digital packages contain item unlocks for your Midair character, including skins, voice packs, and accessories.

The content which will be available through the progression system will offer more variety, but not an advantage in gameplay. This is a priority which we are and will work tirelessly to uphold.</div><div>On launch, Midair will include a $30 option to bypass all player progression and bundled with other goodies and perks. For Kickstarter backers, this same package is discounted to $20 and come with additional Kickstarter-exclusive benefits, such as early access! To learn more, visit our blog for an in-depth post about monetization and progression in Midair:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.playmidair.com/news/monetization-and-progression-in-midair\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 160, 255); font-family: inherit;\">here</span></a>.</div><div>Risks and challenges</div><div>Game development is challenging. Defining “fun” for both new players to the genre and hardened veterans is incredibly complex, requiring a constant cycle of iteration and feedback. In this regard, our team is comprised of individuals that are deeply connected to the FPS-Z community and its competitive scene. We are constantly asking for feedback and suggestions, ensuring we are flexible to make the game we all want to play. This experience, combined with critical evaluation and research of other projects and games, gives us confidence that we can deliver a fantastic experience.</div><div>In addition to gameplay, multiplayer games face a unique challenge in that they typically need a high active player base to keep matches fresh. We chose the F2P model as it supports a low barrier to entry, allowing players from around the world to play together. This being said, Marketing becomes ever more critical in the F2P model as spend helps drive community activity and growth. As part of our Kickstarter campaign, for every dollar raised over our goal you will not only see a higher portion being spent on development, but on marketing as well.</div><div>We will do our absolute best to deliver Midair within the timelines presented; however, there is a possibility that things take longer than expected and timelines get pushed. Game design is iterative and we want to ensure you get the best product possible upon release. Changes to features and design may occur, but we want to share the development of Midair with you, our community, and keep you informed every step of the way.</div><div>We are an independent team of developers from around the world who have been self-funding the development of Midair for the last 2 years, but even with our limited means we have been able to go beyond presenting concept art, having built a playable multiplayer experience in the form of our Pre-Alpha. Our Kickstarter goal of $100,000 is the minimum amount we believe it will take to release Midair within the next 18 months. With your help, we at Archetype will make a fun and exciting experience for both our backers and future players.</div>","owner_id":1,"start_date":null,"slug":"6-midair","closed":false,"is_draft":true,"creation_date":"2016-03-02T11:25:06.558513+00:00","pub_date":"2016-03-02T11:25:06.558513+00:00","end_date":null,"raised":0,"title":"Midair","is_published":false,"media_slider":null,"description":"<div><i>32132121321<b>312321231</b></i></div>","vote_score":0},"id":6,"relationships":{"milestones":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/milestones","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/milestones"}},"rewards":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/rewards","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/rewards"}},"stretch_goals":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/goals","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/goals"}},"votes":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/votes","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/votes"}},"genres":{"data":[{"id":"1","type":"genre"}],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/genres","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/genres"}},"owner":{"data":{"id":"1","type":"user"},"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/owner","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/owner"}},"tags":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/tags","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/tags"}},"pledges":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/pledges","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/pledges"}},"media_content":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/6/media_content","self":"/api/project/6/relationships/media_content"}}},"type":"project"},{"attributes":{"campaign_duration":30,"budget":8787878,"main_post":null,"owner_id":1,"start_date":null,"slug":"22-vuygiuygu","closed":false,"is_draft":true,"creation_date":"2016-03-02T16:05:51.154916+00:00","pub_date":"2016-03-02T16:05:51.154916+00:00","end_date":null,"raised":0,"title":"vuygiuygu","is_published":false,"media_slider":null,"description":"<div>edrftgyhujim</div>","vote_score":0},"id":22,"relationships":{"milestones":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/milestones","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/milestones"}},"rewards":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/rewards","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/rewards"}},"stretch_goals":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/goals","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/goals"}},"votes":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/votes","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/votes"}},"genres":{"data":[{"id":"5","type":"genre"}],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/genres","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/genres"}},"owner":{"data":{"id":"1","type":"user"},"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/owner","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/owner"}},"tags":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/tags","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/tags"}},"pledges":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/pledges","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/pledges"}},"media_content":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/22/media_content","self":"/api/project/22/relationships/media_content"}}},"type":"project"},{"attributes":{"campaign_duration":30,"budget":78878787,"main_post":null,"owner_id":1,"start_date":null,"slug":"25-xcfhgvjhb","closed":false,"is_draft":true,"creation_date":"2016-03-02T16:08:38.427439+00:00","pub_date":"2016-03-02T16:08:38.427439+00:00","end_date":null,"raised":0,"title":"xcfhgvjhb","is_published":false,"media_slider":null,"description":"<div>fgvgvgvgvg</div>","vote_score":0},"id":25,"relationships":{"milestones":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/milestones","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/milestones"}},"rewards":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/rewards","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/rewards"}},"stretch_goals":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/goals","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/goals"}},"votes":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/votes","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/votes"}},"genres":{"data":[{"id":"4","type":"genre"}],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/genres","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/genres"}},"owner":{"data":{"id":"1","type":"user"},"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/owner","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/owner"}},"tags":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/tags","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/tags"}},"pledges":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/pledges","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/pledges"}},"media_content":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/project/25/media_content","self":"/api/project/25/relationships/media_content"}}},"type":"project"},{"attributes":{"campaign_duration":30,"budget":3213213,"main_post":null,"owner_id":1,"start_date":null,"slug":"13-dsadsdsadsad","closed":false,"is_draft":true,"creation_date":"2016-03-02T15:05:43.686396+00:00","pub_date":"2016-03-02T15:05:43.686396+00:00","end_date":null,"raised":0,"title":"dsadsdsadsad","is_published":false,"media_slider":null,"description":"<div>ewqewqewq</div>","vote_score":0},"id":13,"relationships":{"milestones":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/pro

Only on the very first map of the game, we have about 30 particle systems and about 300 sprites.</div><div>-- In the last 10 months we made a good amount of progress developing the game aesthethics and core components, which are already almost done and user-tested.</div><div>That means that we can focus on making content instead of be fiddling too much with core gameplay adjustments. This happened because our game benefits greatly from others awesome platform games like Super Metroid or Fez, where we can scavenge lots of successfull platform-related mechanics.</div><div>Furthermore. the game will be divided in planets, which will help we keep the development modulated and get feedback from backers, correcting bugs, making designs adjustments, balancing difficulty, etc.</div><div>So our biggest challenge will be keeping up with the schedule while not giving up the visual details or compromising the game length. Although its the first project of this team, we are a group of three guys with a lot of experience in game development, and we'll do everything we can to stick to our deadlines and deliver the immersiveness and deepness we've promised in this
